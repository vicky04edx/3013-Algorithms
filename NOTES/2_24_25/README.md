## AVL Trees Notes
- A self balnacing tree 
- Fisrt data structure to be invented
- `Balnace Factor` of a node is the height of itsleft subtree minus the height of its right subtree. 
- The heights of the left and right subtree differ by no more than 1 level. 
- A node with `balance factor` 1,0,-1 is considered balanced
- Insertion is O(log n)
### Operations:
- Insertion into an AVL tree may be carried out by inserting the given value into the tree
