## Graph Coloring and Graph Bipartiteness:

#### Bipartite graph
- Means that the graph can be divided into 2 disjoint sets such that no 2 graph vertices within the same set are adjacent. 

- You can color each pair of adjacent nodes with 2 colors which ensures that none of the same color nodes are touching. 

- If a graph is bipartite then it will not have odd cycles
