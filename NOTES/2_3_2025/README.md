### Circular array based queue

#### Circular queue: 

- Represent real time data, looking for item to coming in and out of a network. 
- INstead of having NULL to the end, connect the last node to the beginning. 
- We still nead HEAD and TAIL pointer

#### Circular array based queue:

- Use mod size of your array to go back to the beginning. 
- This can cause problems so we need to implement measures to prevent it.
